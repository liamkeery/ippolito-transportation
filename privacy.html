Ippolito Transport is eager to receive your comments and answer your questions about our products and our company. However, we are not seeking, nor can we accept, unsolicited ideas, suggestions or materials relating to the development, design, manufacture or marketing of our products. By adhering to this policy, we hope to avoid subsequent misunderstandings among members of the public who submit comments or ideas.
Ippolito Transport will not accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those it has specifically requested. Accordingly, we ask that you do not send us any such materials. If, despite this request, you do submit material to us:
All remarks, suggestions, ideas, graphics, or other information (collectively, "Ideas") that you communicate to Ippolito Transport through our site (other than information we promise to protect under our Privacy Policy), become and remain our property, even if this agreement is later terminated.
This means that...

If we use your Ideas ― or anything similar to them ― we do not have to pay you or anyone else for them;
We will have exclusive ownership of all present and future rights to the Ideas; and
We can use the Ideas for any purpose, without compensating you or anyone else for them. You agree not to assert any ownership right of any kind in the Ideas (including, but not limited to copyright, trademark, unfair competition, moral rights, or implied contract) and you waive the right to receive any financial or other consideration in connection with such unsolicited submission including, but not limited to, credit.
